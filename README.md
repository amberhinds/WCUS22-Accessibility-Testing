# WCUS22-Accessibility-Testing
Slides for Amber's and Alex's Website Accessibility Testing workshop at WordCamp US 2022.

## Session Description
Have you ever wondered if your website is useable for people with disabilities or those using assistive technology? Would you like to make your plugins or themes more accessible?   

This workshop will introduce website accessibility testing and teach participants how to identify accessibility problems using both automated testing tools and manual auditing techniques with keyboard-only navigation and a screen reader. Participants will leave with an understanding of the following:

- Required standards for meeting Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA conformance.
- Recommended tools to use when performing accessibility audits, including WordPress plugins and browser extensions.
- Common accessibility problems that cannot be identified with an automated testing tool and that need to be found manually.
- How to keyboard test a website.
- How to test a website with a screen reader, including basic usage and common keyboard shortcuts for the screen reader relevant to their computer (VoiceOver on Mac or NVDA on Windows).
- Recommended places to find assistive technology users for user testing.

### Attendee Requirements:
This will be an interactive workshop. Please bring a computer and headphones so you can participate fully in the workshop. We recommend having Chrome or Firefox installed on your computer for testing. Windows users, please install the current version of the NVDA screen reader on your computer before attending so you can maximize your testing time during the workshop.
